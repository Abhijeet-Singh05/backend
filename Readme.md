backend project

this is my first backend project

it is a tutorial based project, i am learning this from chai aur code.

Frontend location:

- The frontend scaffold lives in `frontend/` relative to the repository root.
- Absolute path example on this machine: `E:\mscode\web\backend\frontend`

To run the frontend locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
